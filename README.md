# Prediction-of-stock-prices-for-Netflix
Description: A near future trend of the prices of stock of Netflix company. The problem which I am trying to solve is to predict the price of stocks of Netflix for the next 4 days. Usage of the project: This prediction is statistically sound but it doesn't capture the emotional factors that might influence the market.
General notes: I used a Stacked LSTM model, a chain-like time series model which uses the last 100 days to forecast the price for the next 4 days.
